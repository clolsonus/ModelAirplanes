# Tiny Tutor Hop Up Parts

This project is developed in FreeCAD (.FCStd is the FreeCAD file format.)  You
can open it up, select specific components, export to .stl, import the .stl into
your slicer program, slice, and print.

Recommended settings at the moment are 5% gyroid infill, 1 wall loop, 3
top/bottom layers.  100% flow rate seems to work pretty ok for my spool of
LW-PLA, and otherwise just use PLA settings.  I've experimented with different
flow rates and speeds and only made things worse.

You will need to purchase the Tiny Tutor kit from Flite Test along with their
recommended power pack in order to complete this model.  The parts here are
intended to replace some of the stock parts.

I have not flown the completed model yet, but the 3d parts will add weight and
this will change the flying characteristics somewhat.  I am contemplating
scratch building a larger span wing as well.

This is all an experiment to learn a bit about FreeCAD, learn a bit about 3d
printing, and have fun with a DIY project.
